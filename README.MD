# Project Pyra
Welcome to Project Pyra a project for 
learning about programming languages and how they work internally

## Pyra Language
Pyra is a statically typed language based on Rust, Python, Go and C#

```pyra
let msg = "Hello Pyra!";
println(msg);
```


### Idea's to implement

_Some main idea's to add (written by ChatGPT):_

1. **Concurrency and Parallelism from Go:** Go (Golang) is known for its strong 
support for concurrency and parallelism through goroutines and channels. 
Consider adding lightweight threads or a similar mechanism to simplify 
concurrent programming.

2. **Pattern Matching from Rust and Scala:** Rust's pattern matching is powerful and 
concise. Scala also has an expressive pattern matching syntax. 
Integrating pattern matching can enhance the readability and 
expressiveness of your language.

3. **Type Inference from Haskell:** Haskell's strong type inference system allows for 
expressive code without explicit type annotations. Adopting a sophisticated 
type inference mechanism can improve code clarity and reduce redundancy.

4. **Functional Programming Constructs from Scala and Haskell:** Features like 
immutability, first-class functions and higher-order functions 
contribute to functional programming paradigms.
Integrating these constructs can make your language suitable for functional programming.

5. **Async/Await from JavaScript and Python:** Asynchronous programming is crucial for 
handling I/O-bound operations efficiently. Adopting async/await syntax can simplify 
asynchronous code and make it more readable.

6. **Memory Safety from Rust:** Rust is known for its emphasis on memory safety 
without sacrificing performance. 
Incorporating ownership and borrowing concepts can help prevent common 
memory-related bugs.

7. **Metaprogramming from Lisp:** Lisp languages are famous for their 
metaprogramming capabilities. Consider incorporating features 
like macros that allow developers to write code that generates code.

8. **Package Management from npm (Node.js) and Cargo (Rust):** 
Streamlined package management systems can simplify dependency management. 
Creating a dedicated package manager for your language can enhance 
the development experience.

9. **Property-Based Testing from Haskell and Scala:** Property-based testing 
allows developers to specify general properties that should 
hold for a range of inputs. Integrating this testing approach can 
improve code reliability.

10. **Unified Syntax from Swift:** Swift is designed with a clear 
and concise syntax that is easy to read and write. 
Striving for a unified and intuitive syntax can enhance the developer experience.

11. **Interoperability from Kotlin:** Kotlin has excellent interoperability with Java, 
making it easy for developers to transition between the two languages.
Consider designing your language to seamlessly work with 
existing codebases in other languages.
